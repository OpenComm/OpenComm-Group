First I upgraded yum, the software installation tool for Fedora (we are running the server on Fedora 12 32bits):
//
yum update
//

(Maybe we won't need mysql right now so feel free not to start it
Install mysql:
//
yum install mysql mysql-server
//

Configure it:
Start at boot
//
chkconfig --levels 235 mysqld on
//
How to start the server
//
/etc/init.d/mysqld start
//

Configure mysql
//
mysql_secure_installation
//
)

Then Just install Nginx, which is prefered to Apache for VPS
//
yum install nginx
//
Start at boot
//
chkconfig --levels 235 nginx on
//

Start Nginx
//
service nginx start
//

/!\ I get the following error:
Starting nginx: [emerg]: bind() to 0.0.0.0:80 failed (98: Address already in use               )
[emerg]: bind() to 0.0.0.0:80 failed (98: Address already in use)
[emerg]: bind() to 0.0.0.0:80 failed (98: Address already in use)
[emerg]: bind() to 0.0.0.0:80 failed (98: Address already in use)
[emerg]: bind() to 0.0.0.0:80 failed (98: Address already in use)
[emerg]: still could not bind()

|~|Fix:
If you type:
//
fuser -n tcp 80
//  
you should have list of numbers after 80/tcp such as:
80/tcp:              26621 26622

for each of them just do:
//
kill -9 601
kill -9 26622
//

Just start Nginx again:
//
service nginx start
//
It should work. Otherwise hang yourself. Just kidding. Coz' otherwise I would be dead.

If it still doesn't work but you have a very strong feeling that Apache is installed (maybe because when you type in your ip address in a web browser it shows Apache 2.2 everywhere though Nginx is installed), just uninstall it, duh.
//
yum remove httpd
//

Now you can hang yourself if it doesn't work after that.

If you're not dead, you can set up PHP [you might want to stop mysql before by typing 'service mysqld stop', it takes a lot of ressources]
//
yum install lighttpd-fastcgi php-cli php-mysql php-gd php-imap php-ldap php-odbc php-pear php-xml php-xmlrpc php-eaccelerator php-magickwand php-magpierss php-mbstring php-mcrypt php-mssql php-shout php-snmp php-soap php-tidy
//|
Then to configure, open
//
vi /etc/php.ini
//
and type in (*a to append, del to suppress, :wq to write and quit)
//
cgi.fix_pathinfo = 1
//

To start PHP just do
//
/usr/bin/spawn-fcgi -a 127.0.0.1 -p 9000 -u nginx -g nginx -f /usr/bin/php-cgi -P /var/run/fastcgi-php.pid
//
and append this line at the end of the file:
//
vi /etc/rc.local
//

If it doesn't start, unfortunately I have no fix because it starts for me. Stop relying on other people, they are not as good as you are <3 (please don't hit me).

BTW, ifconfig can be useful to get the ip address.

Configure Nginx:
Go in this file
//
vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
//
You might want to look at the first link at the top of this documentation to know what to do (page 2)

When you are finished, restart Nginx
//
/etc/init.d/nginx restart
//

go to /usr/share/nginx/html/, read index.html and save it to index.php
//
cd /usr/share/nginx/html/
vi index.html
:w index.php
:q
//

Stay in this folder and create info.php
//
vi info.php
//
Put this code: 
/!
<?php
phpinfo();
?>
!/
Save and quit :wq

Now try this code. In your web browser: my_ip_address_I_got_from_ifconfig/info.php

You should see a beautiful page of PHPinfo. If not, uninstall Internet Explorer and get a real browser. Or burn the hand of the person sitting next to you. If you are alone, just stab your wrist with a fork and try the configuration part again, you must have made a mistake. Seriously, this is important stuff.

Now we are getting a little ahead.

Install PHPmail (library for PHP)
//
yum install php-PHPMailer
//

Install a secure FTP
//
yum install vsftpd
//
And configure it (taken on http://www.noob2geek.com/linux/setup-vsftpd-debian-ubuntu/):
//
service vsftpd stop
vi /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf
//
From the website: 
We don’t want anonymous login:

anonymous_enable=NO

Enable local users:

local_enable=YES

The ftpuser should be able to write data:

write_enable=YES

Port 20 need to turned off, makes vsftpd run less privileged:

connect_from_port_20=NO

Chroot everyone:

chroot_local_user=YES

set umask to 022 to make sure that all the files (644) and folders (755) you upload get the proper permissions.

local_umask=022

And now, add the user
//
sudo useradd -d /var/www/html -s /usr/sbin/nologin flavian
sudo passwd flavian
//
Then type in your password (@pencomm for me).

Give ALL the permissions! (doesn't work?)
//
sudo chown -R flavian /var/www/html
sudo chmod 775 /var/www/html
//

Create the userlist and add the user:
//
vi /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.userlist
(type flavian or whatever your user name is, because if you are not me you won't put my name, or you might but you shall have to worship me 'till you're dead human, and sacrifice goats in my name and eat their heart with unicorn puppets.)
//

Open the conf file again (the website made a mistake here for Fedora)
//
vi /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf
//

Add this at the end:
//
# the list of users to give access
userlist_file=/etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.userlist (and not userlist_file=/etc/vsftpd.userlist as the website says, grow a critical mind, dammit!)

# this list is on
userlist_enable=YES

# It is not a list of users to deny ftp access
userlist_deny=NO
//

Open the shell file
//
vi /etc/shells
//
and add this line at the end: 
//
/usr/sbin/nologin
//

I'm not sure how useful are the next lines, but it doesn't hurt to type them
//
sudo addgroup ftpusers
sudo usermod -Gftpusers flavian
//
If it doesn't work, don't worry too much IMO.

Now start the service:
//
service vsftpd start
//

Once again, if something doesn't work properly, get your fingers out of you ass. Thank you.

By the way, don't forget to put the same folders between the FTP and what nginx reads.
//
vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
//
So put /var/www/html in there. Duh.
Same for this configuration file: 
//
vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
//

By the way to copy the contents of a folder do
//
cp -a /usr/share/nginx/html /var/www/html
//
and to remove a full folder
//
rm -rf /var/www/html/html
//

You might want to generate a htpasswd to protect your auth data. Well you MUST.

SMTP: 
http://fedorasolved.org/server-solutions/postfix-mail-server

//
yum install postfix mysql-server spamassassin clamav amavisd-new cyrus-sasl clamav-update sqlgrey
//
And now...
//
vi /etc/postfix/main.cf
