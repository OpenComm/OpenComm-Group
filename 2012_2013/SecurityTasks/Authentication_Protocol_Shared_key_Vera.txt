In order to initiate a protocol and ensure that the passing of the private symmetric key that is generated by the user, we will use the following protocol.
- We assume client knows server's public key.

When client and server originally connect, before the user logs in:
C: generate r, a random value, and generate k_u a shared key that will be used between client and server in further communication
C->S: {r k_u}K_SS->U: {r,n}k_u   where n is a new random value generated by SU->S: {username,password,(n+1)}k_uS: check if H(password) == H_u where H_u is hash of the password stored on the server for the given user.		If H(password) == H_u:			User is authenticated		Else: 			Fail to authenticate user
- Following this, the user and server communicate by incrementing n and checking to make sure it is in the right sequential order
