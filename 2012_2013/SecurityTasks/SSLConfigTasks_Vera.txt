SSL Protocol:
   Properties:
	(1) Authenticates
		a. Established symmetric key with handshake via public key
		b. Prevents replay attacks by using MACS(Message Auth. Codes) or checksums
			i. The reason it prevents replay attacks is because the MAC is computed from the MAC secret, the sequence number, message length, message contents, and two fixed character strings. 
		c. Ensures integrity via symmetric key encryption during communication, also via cryptographic functions


STEPS/WHAT NEEDS TO BE CONFIGURED:
