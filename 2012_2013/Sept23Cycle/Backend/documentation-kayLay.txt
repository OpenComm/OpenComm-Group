sendEmail:

The implementation is pretty straightforward. Inside the Main Activity I press a button to send an email from my account- lei.kevin.n@gmail.com.
You have to specify the email and password inside constructor of GMailerclass. Here is how implementation works:

(i) Specify the constructor with your gmail's account name and password- I am using gmail's stmp server (stmp.gmail.com)
(ii) Specify an array of String of recipient(s) to receive the email 
(iii) specify 'from', 'subject', and 'body'.

THIS IS NOT ACTUALLY HOW OUR IMPLEMENTATION IS SUPPOSED WORK- WE ARE PLANNING ON USING A PLUGIN THAT WORKS WITH OUR PHP SERVER-
HOWEVER- WE WANT TO SEND AN EMAIL TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN WE LOGIN- AN EMAIL IS JUST SENT :) ...(don't ask me why I am the code 
monkey)

AccountCreationBackend:

	This is even easier...we create an accountManager at the onCreate and then we call on the method 
	
	(i) creation() -HARDCODED ACCOUNT...IF ACCOUNT CREATION IS SUCCESSFUL WE MUST CHANGE THE HARDCODED ACCOUNT BECAUSE NOW THE ACCOUNT
	EXISTS!
	(ii) creation( user, password)
	
	**FOR SOME REASON- WE ARE THROWING AN XMPPException EVERY TIME WE TRY TO CREATE AN ACCOUNT- I KNOW THIS ISN'T WRONG BECAUSE
	IN SMACK+ECLIPSE DEV ENVIRONMENT (ALSO INCLUDED IN MY FILES) IT WORKS! ** (i dunnozzz :( )
