http://library.linode.com/web-servers/nginx/php-fastcgi/fedora-13

First I upgraded yum, the software installation tool for Fedora (we are running the server on Fedora 12 32bits):
//
yum update
//

(Maybe we won't need mysql right now so feel free not to start it
Install mysql:
//
yum install mysql mysql-server
//

Configure it:
Start at boot
//
chkconfig --levels 235 mysqld on
//
How to start the server
//
/etc/init.d/mysqld start
//

Configure mysql
//
mysql_secure_installation
//
)

Then Just install Nginx, which is prefered to Apache for VPS
//
yum install nginx
//
Start at boot
//
chkconfig --levels 235 nginx on
//

Start Nginx
//
service nginx start
//

/!\ I get the following error:
Starting nginx: [emerg]: bind() to 0.0.0.0:80 failed (98: Address already in use               )
[emerg]: bind() to 0.0.0.0:80 failed (98: Address already in use)
[emerg]: bind() to 0.0.0.0:80 failed (98: Address already in use)
[emerg]: bind() to 0.0.0.0:80 failed (98: Address already in use)
[emerg]: bind() to 0.0.0.0:80 failed (98: Address already in use)
[emerg]: still could not bind()

|~|Fix:
If you type:
//
fuser -n tcp 80
//  
you should have list of numbers after 80/tcp such as:
80/tcp:              26621 26622

for each of them just do:
//
kill -9 26621
kill -9 26622
//

Just start Nginx again:
//
service nginx start
//
It should work. Otherwise hang yourself. Just kidding. Coz' otherwise I would be dead.

If it still doesn't work but you have a very strong feeling that Apache is installed (maybe because when you type in your ip address in a web browser it shows Apache 2.2 everywhere though Nginx is installed), just uninstall it, duh.
//
yum remove httpd
//

Now you can hang yourself if it doesn't work after that.

If you're not dead, you can set up PHP [you might want to stop mysql before by typing 'service mysqld stop', it takes a lot of ressources]
//
yum install lighttpd-fastcgi php-cli php-mysql php-gd php-imap php-ldap php-odbc php-pear php-xml php-xmlrpc php-eaccelerator php-magickwand php-magpierss php-mbstring php-mcrypt php-mssql php-shout php-snmp php-soap php-tidy
//|
Then to configure, open
//
vi /etc/php.ini
//
and type in (*a to append, del to suppress, :wq to write and quit)
//
cgi.fix_pathinfo = 1
//

To start PHP just do
//
/usr/bin/spawn-fcgi -a 127.0.0.1 -p 9000 -u nginx -g nginx -f /usr/bin/php-cgi -P /var/run/fastcgi-php.pid
//
and append this line at the end of the file:
//
vi /etc/rc.local
//

If it doesn't start, unfortunately I have no fix because it starts for me. Stop relying on other people, they are not as good as you are <3 (please don't hit me).

BTW, ifconfig can be useful to get the ip address.

Configure Nginx:
Go in this file
//
vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
//
You might want to look at the first link at the top of this documentation to know what to do (page 2)

When you are finished, restart Nginx
//
/etc/init.d/nginx restart
//

go to /usr/share/nginx/html/, read index.html and save it to index.php
//
cd /usr/share/nginx/html/
vi index.html
:w index.php
:q
//

Stay in this folder and create info.php
//
vi info.php
//
Put this code: 
/!
<?php
phpinfo();
?>
!/
Save and quit :wq

Now try this code. In your web browser: my_ip_address_I_got_from_ifconfig/info.php

You should see a beautiful page of PHPinfo. If not, uninstall Internet Explorer and get a real browser. Or burn the hand of the person sitting next to you. If you are alone, just stab your wrist with a fork and try the configuration part again, you must have made a mistake. Seriously, this is important stuff.
